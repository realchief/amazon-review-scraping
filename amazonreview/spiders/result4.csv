"This movie was funny, i am not a Will Farrell fan in the least, (in fact i despise him) but i watched part 1 of this movie earlier on in the night and i just HAD to see part two.  it was hilarious.  Not only was Farrell tolerable he actually mad me laugh for a change, he totally changed his persona and was not the normal obnoxious actor he once was, Mark wahlberg put on a great display.  Lets just say i personally was impressed with the movie and i am a tough critic.","May 17, 2018",Robert Januchowski,Daddy's Home 2,5.0
"I think if one is not used to real quality writers...well orchestrated scenes...used to the quality that movies used to have..then a simple mind would be content w/this.  It seemed as tho' the writers were not committed to a well written play, had the feel of rushed to put together ""SOMETHING"" that could be put out before Christmas.  Mel Gibson playing a rebel rouser who acted much like a drunkekn sailor w/no real morals, Will Ferrel who is suppose to keep rolling on his past so called comedy conquest....John Lithgow always is an excellent performer....the kids were surrounded by bad parenting, they get intoxicated become foul mouthed...the little brother has a thing for his sister, albeit step sister, which is not known until the end when he kisses her. Then there is a line of young girls to get their kisses from him while standing under the mistle toe & then you see a small boy who is in line to kiss him which is more of the movie industry preying on children & twisting their minds. Earlier in the movie Ferrel stated he had a genderless flash cards in order to give the 8yrs old son the ""talk""...which is hellyweirds way of gender confusion goals. I didn't laugh once. This is NOT a family movie & would NEVER PERMIT ANY OF MY CHILDREN TO WATCH IT nor would I pay to rent it. I'm very surprised Mel Gibson would even accept such a raunchy part whose role was to be an absentee disapointing father figure. It has more of a feel that they  used the A List of Actors to sell this movie because the script itself could never sell it. If you want to waste time & don't care on what you waste your time then this would be the movie for that.  Just like the music of my era...young adults disapointed in todays generation of music...nothing original, nor creative...all sounds the same...back in the 60's, 70's & 80's great years in music & from the 40's, 50's, 60's, 70's & even the 80's were great years in movies.  Real wit, humor, orchestration....family movie's were family movies...there were no bad languages or horrors of remarks of genitals making a man or not....scripts took talent...being ingenious..I didn't laugh once thru out this movie, was glad it was over & don't want to ever endure anything like this again.  Flat out insulting. It would not have been hard to have made this into a really good family movie...if that would be the goal, but obviously wasn't the goal nor the intentions of this movie","November 23, 2018",Talara Masters,Daddy's Home 2,2.0
"Holy wow, I was really liking this movie, thought I'd play it for all the kids when they come for xmas, seems like a pretty well made kids xmas movie.. then 2/3 thru the movie they present guns right propaganda and handing a little kid a gun to kill an animal.  You can tell there's 2 right wingers in this movie (Mark Wahlberg and Mel Gibson).  I'm just flabbergasted they put this horrid scene into the movie.  There should be a WARNING about this propaganda before parents innocently have their kids exposed to this propaganda without them knowing what's in the movie.","November 22, 2018",CherryM,Daddy's Home 2,1.0
I love Zombieland. It is one of the few movies I think that understands how to have fun and be humorous while still treating the character relationships and development seriously.

"I thought I was getting a zombie comedy movie, instead I got a boring teen romance movie with zombies in the background. One huge problem is there's never any sense of danger or urgency, so I wasn't invested emotionally with any of the characters. I didn't care if they lived or died or whether low rent Michael Cera clone Jesse Eisenberg would hook up with Emma Stone or whether Woody Harrelson ever finds a Twinkie. This movie is in fact one big Twinkie. It's too light and sugary for my taste and has zero nutritional value. Oh sure the movie looks good at first, but the comedy (and zombies) feel like tacked on accessories to a predictable and ultimately pandering Hollywood plot. The ""hero"" learns to engage with other humans and finds the family he's always been looking for including the girl of course. Woody Harrelson is just there for contrast and to help the ""hero"" on his journey. The one exception to the general tedium is a cameo by Bill Murray. Unfortunately his role is a small and all too brief one. You want a funny and original zombie movie? Watch Shaun Of The Dead. This one might be good to watch while folding laundry.","May 30, 2019",Chet Fakir,Zombieland,2.0

"Frieda Ferrell the actress portrays herself in what she claims to be a true story.  However, it is not a true story.  Frieda Ferrell was a model before the alleged incident, not a Pilates instructor.  The alleged event happened in London, not the US.  She did not have a daughter.  She was allegedly held for three days.  After her alleged escape, she waited several days to contact the police and she never contacted her boyfriend at the time again.  The police apparently found her story implausible, although they did investigate.  Of course her alleged captor never apprehended.  The police have not corroborated her story or commented on the case.  While it is important to believe people when they report crimes, it is also important to require evidence and corroboration and not believe every story you hear, especially when the story is presented in a way that seems to be more for the purpose of advancing your career rather than stopping and punishing terrible crimes.  The movie itself is a piece of trash, even as a horror thriller, with no psychological tension.","February 20, 2019",Veronica L,Apartment 407,1.0
"In what seems like one of the most indie films of the year, Donald Glover and Rihanna take on a story of love, war, and everything in between. With cinematography that echoes City of God and a soundtrack that screams Gambino this movie will not disappoint.

"They tried. They spent way too much time setting up a pointless crime angle and backstory about the effects on family when a ""good cop"" goes bad (or makes a career-ending stupid decision), and then they didn't really have enough story to fill the rest of the movie. So they dragged it out. They have a few good moments and some good lines, but it wasn't enough. It plods along, then gets interesting for a few minutes, and then it plods again, plods some more, and then wraps it all up with a nice little bow when the ""good guys"" win over the bad guys and the other, side story bad guys. -- Andrew Murray as Philip and the young man who played his son were the only two with any presence on screen. Technically, the prosthetic monster makeups were excellent. Those are what the movie had going for it. -- Some reviewers try to make hay out of the lunatic ""Lizard People"" global conspiracy theory, saying it's what makes the movie intelligent, erudite, clever, and all that. Bless'em. They're reaching. -- ""Killers Inside"" is pretty much standard fare B-horror, a creature feature using the typical vampire movie premise, and when it gets going it's really just a bug hunt. That said, there are a lot of way worse movies out there. -- Watch it if you have nothing better to do and/or need to pass the time... or you review movies. 4/10","May 2, 2019",M.

"I thought this was a very good movie!  On the surface of the story is a woman who suffers a sudden devastating loss of a child and the subtext was the mental and emotional break she experiences due to an act of senseless violence.  I thought the subplot of mental illness was clever and added a twist to the story that I never saw coming.  Another underlining coincidence was the use of the name ""Eve;"" according to biblical reference, the first Mother to experience the murder of her child, Abel, by his brother, Cain.

"Bite the hand that feeds you is the socialist motto of this film. While deeming capitalism and comparing US capitalism to totalitarianism capitalism, this film is trying to fit the narrative to socialize the US while also telling those of small countries or small island groups to look away from capitalism and stay within your tradition. I do agree with the latter, but it is nearly a fantasy that is ignorant to the expansion and evolution on an 'intelligent' or industrialized civilisation. I am not saying that I disagree with all of CG's messages, but only stating an observation of the ill ideology popularized fad on the internet. It's hard to watch CG talk about socialising the island while he enjoys the fruits of modern technology, parading around all high and mighty on his moral high ground blessed by the people around him. It's hard to like this movie when he demonises the US while comparing it to a full work week controlled by a totalitarian dictator of which we do not have.","April 13, 2019",Tumitime,Guava Island,1.0

It stars Demi Moore, who in 1993 was in her prime as an actress and physically being absolutely gorgeous (not that she is bad now), Woody Harrleson who was probably at the height of his popularity coming off of Cheers, and Robert Redford who was probably on the other side of his leading man status, which actually worked well for the role he played. The story is simple, a young couple in financial trouble decides to go to Vegas (of all places) to try to turn a little bit of money into enough to get out of debt.

"I gave this movie 5 stars because I truly believe Jodie Foster and Kelly McGillis did a great job or portraying a rape victim and a prosecutor. This is based on a true story. The person in the movie was not the victim but this really happened. I can not even imagine going through something like this and having people cheering this on. To me, that room and atmosphere was filled with the worst sort of perversion. Rape is not just a sexual crime, it is a violent, aggressive act against another human. It is force, and bullying and a disconnected crime with the inability to express self-control and compassion for the victim. I am very thankful that because of a very brave young woman, laws were changed. There is still a lot of work to be done for rape victims and the offenders to not only bring them to justice but a great deal to be done to prevent these crimes. I learned a few things from this portrayal. I am very aware that if one is not in the room or present during the crime, it is a great challenge for them to imagine and get upset enough to persecute or put forth a vote of guilty. That is why it takes very brave people to tell the whole story. This movie was very good for teaching. It is a good study of human behavior. I am glad I viewed it again. I wonder if the rape scene will haunt the male actors. It was very graphic and maybe at that time, it was a shock to many viewers. I myself could not have watched this in a movie theatre. I saw it on cable years ago in the privacy of my home and now again streaming. My heart went out to the victim. It is not in me to shame a victim. It does not matter that she was drinking, flirting or dancing seductively. That is a part of who she was and a choice she got to make. The actual aggressive act was about the offenders and God help us if we, as a society fall asleep and allow this crime to go unpunished. It matters! It matters for the weaker in our society. And at that moment, she was weak. These men were predators and anyone could be a victim. She walked right into their lair. The statistics given at the end of the movie tell me, a viewer that this movie was not some crap piece taking advantage but an effort to educate the public. I recommend this movie for young men to view. I do not recommend for young children or female teens as I am sure it would be emotionally disturbing but maybe it would prevent someone from thinking it is okay to get drunk at a bar. In those situations anything can happen. A theft, a rape, a murder, a bar fight, a car accident. We all know better. Good job people. Good effort.","May 22, 2019",Ladybug52,The Accused,5.0

This actually happens way too many times in real life. All that someone like her has to endure by mockers, the boys she is trying to put away and those siding with them and the control they have over those who should say something but for many reasons are afraid of the repercussions.

Sometimes a movie isn't perfect, but it's everything it's trying to be, and I think that's the case here.

"I rented this movie on ondemand the first day it came out. Being a fan of anything that Keanu Reeves is in I was anxiously awaiting this movie as I knew it would be a different kind of movie for him.  Mr. Reeves is a totally wonderful action star, but he is also a great actor when it comes to dark and psychological movies.  This movie lived up to my expectations.  This movie is a tragic love story between two people who are from different cultures and who have lives that they are trapped in. When they are thrown together because of a diamond deal gone awry, they develop a relationship that is both sensual, emotional and yes loving even though he is married and she is supposedly engaged.  They become entangled in the Russian mob about the diamond deal.  Then things get dicey.  The Russians don’t play and they put these two people in a violent situation that they try to escape from.  I thought the story was great.  The characters were well played by Keanu and Una and their chemistry worked.  They both exhibited great emotions throughout the movie.  Keanu’s command of the Russian language was perfect.  That in itself shows the work and passion he puts into every role he plays.  All I can say is if you’re not interested in seeing a well thought out and acted movie for mature people who appreciate the noir type of movie, then this movie is not for you.  Of course there are a lot of CGI movies out there to hold your attention without you having to invest yourself in a thought provoking movie. I already have the Blu-ray DVD.

"It is relatively easy to be skeptical about at least the details of the movie, since it does not quite fit with even the original story when it came out. The movie gives you the impression that the pace of violations were over several days, and indeed the time of captivity was alleged to be three days and two nights. However the impression one gets from the film is that this is a much longer period. The original story is that she was drugged right away on the second visit, not threatened with a knife and forced to drink the laced milk. The original story was she was raped by twelve men, or eight, or other numbers at different tellings until it settled in at eight. She escaped not by avoiding the fatal injection at the last minute by a phone call from her captor in the next room who had decided to off her himself then being knocked unconscious by the self-freed, handcuff-knuckled heroine. She escaped, she told authorities, because he had left the door unlocked. It also was in London, not anywhere in the United States.","April 8, 2019",Mike,Apartment 407,2.0

Kate Bosworth as his wife will probably annoy you for about half the movie, but it's really all about her transformation from denial of the disintegration of America and her relationship to stepping up and taking responsibility for her life.

"Excellent movie that is thought provoking.  It makes you wonder what goes through the minds of mothers who lose their kids too early.  In this case, the mother, Lila, goes to a support group after her son was killed by a drive-by shooting.  While at the group, she met a friend, Eve, who she chooses to be her sponsor so that she can be supported to reach her goals.  Lila is able to relate with Eve because Eve seems to know what Lila is feeling and offers just the right advice to make her feel better each time.  However, is Eve really trying to help Lila or is Eve using Lila to satisfy her own craving for danger.  What you discover later in the movie will be a shock.  It's a smart movie and well directed.

"I have mixed feelings on the movie.  For one thing, they never explained what brought about the apocalypse.  Nor a time frame for the gangs to get to where they were.  But it put forth a future that was very brutal, and in this movie, there is no shortage of blood.  And early on, they fall back on the cliche that if you tell the gang member what they want to know, you will live.  One clear mistake I noticed is when the shot went through the windshield to hit Nina, she had a bloody shoulder wound, but there was blood on the windshield where the bullet went through, which makes no sense.  But other than that, the movie was tight.  Mark and Nina are the central characters, other than Betsy, and their marriage is not that great.  It is Nina that undergoes the change during their journey.  Nina will really annoy a person for nearly the first half of the movie.  The radio voice really added to the movie, and the voice reminded me of Rush, although the language is VERY salty.  The movie was slow at times and Mark and Nina did some really stupid things so they were flawed individuals.  The gangs have a element of Mad Max about them.  And the movie portrays that society is really bottom feeding, and very grimy.  Nathan and Theresa were perhaps the two most noble characters in the entire movie.

Joey worked for a used car lot and Tim Robbin's character Larry comes in a takes everyone hostage because he is worried that his wife who works there is cheating on him. Larry is not a very good hostage taker and Joey has to tell him how to be a hostage taker. Joey has made mistakes in his life too so that helps him understand and help Larry. The movie shows how everyone can get in trouble sometimes but that doesn't make them a bad person. Even though it is a hostage situation, it is not scary. It is actually a comedy. If you are a Robin Williams fan and want to take a look at his earlier work, this is a fun movie to watch.","October 5, 2014",Jolene Wipf,Cadillac Man,5.0
"Not generally my kind of movie, bought it for the wife. But, I have to admit, I really enjoyed it. I have always liked Queen Latifah Movies, they have a certain comedic element to them that brings me back to classic comedy. Beauty Shop delivers in so many ways.  This movie boasts a number of stars including Kevin Bacon. In this Bacon is the man you love to hate, right from the start and Latifah is the woman who is the little guy who has to rise to the level of the competitive business she wants to be in. The movie will have you laughing from start to finish. I highly recommend it to anyone who likes to laugh, and doubly so to anyone who likes Queen Latifah.","June 21, 2017",Rodney C Walmer,Beauty Shop,5.0
"I don't understand how the top critical review didn't grab this person. The movie is a very touching movie. I guess some people in this world don't get the true meaning of love. It grabbed me and I embraced it. Bravo for the Actors, Writers and Producers. For the pooh pooh people has someone ever touched you life like this movie and eventually you gave in to the love? If not I really feel sorry for you. I have that kind of Love with my husband now over thirty years now and part of the movie really touched me. When the Dad was explaining how he cheated on his wife and how he told her right away. I did that with my husband thirty years ago and I told my boyfriend right away who is now my husband. I guess some people like myself have a conscious and was scared and not quite sure of what I was getting into but at least I had the balls to say it and I was lucky enough to have married that boyfriend who forgave me. Life lessons are in this movie and True Love was shown. I know this review has nothing to do about the movie but when it comes down to it Love comes in all colors shapes sizes and The Big Sick showed it and I loved how it showed it I am also glad that it was based on a true story. So again if you want to really see a good movie about Love take a two hours out of you life and feel it. Because I sure did. Thank You Amazon for making this movie I hope the critical reviewers get to feel this kind of Love someday every being deserves that feeling.","November 24, 2017",Mushroomie,The Big Sick,5.0
"Uncreative title, bland movie jacket, never heard of it - expectations were running low. But...ZING: great movie. Despite its romcom overlay, it's quite a profound examination of the complexities of friendship, loneliness, uncertainty, ambition, joy, love. In short, it's an insightful look at this wacky journey called ""life."" I particularly like the fact there are no ""bad"" guys - just a bunch of young adults making their way through life as best they can, and making a go of it in the end. And as a bonus? Some very funny lines.","December 26, 2017",laurie,What If,5.0
"A wonderful film about a girl's senior year in Catholic school, her first serious boyfriend and her dreams of moving far away to attend college. It is all realistic from the way she longs to be in NY rather than the boring town she grew up in to her very realistic mother/daughter relationship that is frustrating sometimes and loving too. She is embarrassed by her parents and the fact that she isn't one of the rich girls. She buddies up with kids that seem very intelligent and unique only to discover they are just pretentious. It might be the most true mother/ daughter relationship I have ever seen in a film. The writing is excellent. I hate films with teenagers who all talk like adults in a Woody Allen film. The teens here speak realistically for their age. The acting is excellent. Both Saoirse Ronan and Lori Metcalf are perfect in their roles. Highly recommended.","March 27, 2018",M. Mara,Lady Bird,5.0
"The description says and I quote, ""a solitary janitor whose life is transformed after he becomes the guardian of his 16 yr old nephew."" Spoiler alert: his life is NOT transformed, he is the same as when he started. Two hours of my life I will not get back, I kept hoping for something to redeem this movie but there is none. For those saying this is ""real life"", two things, one I don't watch movies for real life, I watch to be moved, to be inspired,  to be uplifted. And two, real life is actually not as bad as this movie was, this isn't ""real life"", this is ""worst case scenario"" no hope garbage.","August 31, 2018",T. Travis,Manchester By The Sea,1.0
"“ROAD HOUSE"" This is THE iconic cult classic movie that won 4 Oscars in 1989.  Patrick Swayze and Sam Elliott are at their heroic kickass best.  The great supporting cast headed by a sadistic Ben Gazzara as the tyrannical smug landowner is perfect; as is Kevin Tighe's white-haired dignified club owner, and the smartly sexy Kelly Lynch.  Add a motley group of bar dwellers that can never again be duplicated, and you have a vintage action-packed epic movie.","April 2, 2018",S. J. VOLK,Road House,5.0
"In case you can't tell from the title, cover, trailer, blurb, etc., this is a sh!ts and giggles gun fight movie. That's it. No before, no after, no major plot, just a lot of good actors who rolled around in the 70s section of the wardrobe dept,  loaded up on guns and met up in a warehouse full of charges for no good reason. In that way, its absolutely fantastic.","January 13, 2018",Shannon Nikic,Free Fire,4.0
"So maybe this isn't a five star film.. probably not for most.  I, on the other hand love a good unsolicited laugh, and I'm no pushover for a laugh..  This movie is really funny, with an obvious all star cast who seem to have made this film out of the love for the story.. great cameo's and small role players.  I would never give anything away, I just say if you need a break from the norm, and want a smile on your face.. give this gem a shot..","June 2, 2018",Shallow Graves,The Disaster Artist,5.0
"If you thought Martin Scorsese would go into his twilight years resting on past successes this film will make you think again.  ""Silence"" is a film of immense power and depth that will make one examine your long held beliefs.  Scorsese posits here the idea that it is much easier to sacrifice oneself for your faith but is it conscionable to sacrifice others for your convictions?  This is not an easy film to watch but compelling nonetheless.  When the film concludes its title garners meaning and resonance.  Enough cannot be said about Andrew Garfield as Father Rodrigues, an idealistic missionary sent to feudal Japan to investigate claims of persecution against Christians.  I couldn't help but contrast his work here to his equally fine performance in Mel Gibson's ""Hacksaw Ridge""  as Desmond Doss, a religious conscientious objector who served valiantly as a medic in the Pacific Theatre during World War II.  Both characters find their faith tested who ultimately make fateful choices.  Liam Neeson is terrific as Father Ferrera the enigmatic mentor of Rodrigues who preceded him to Japan whose choices ultimately influence the younger cleric.  The film leaves you asking yourself what would you do if confronted with a gut wrenching choice and life leaves no easy answers.","April 9, 2017",David E. Baldwin,Silence,5.0
"If Richard Flarerty was only the shortest man to ever be in the US Army and A Green Beret that would certainly be a unique story in itself.  Flarety was much more though.  He was a bonafide war hero and beloved leader of the men he commanded.  A small stature with a oversized shadow.  Yet he was cut from the Army that was his life after two tours in Vietnam.  This story documents as much as can be known about a man whose post army life was spent in a variety of jobs freelancing and alternating between classified missions conducted by the CIA and NSA.  Eventually he ended up with a mundane Postal Service job which he hated and after some years walked away from.  This is when he began his homeless period.  It would seem farfetched of course but much of Richard Flarertys life could be summed up as such.  What an interesting man and totally unique story.  I think the movie does a great job of shedding some light into this hero who preferred dangerous work over the everyday.  Obviously for a man who preferred to remain mostly obscure there must be so much more, but what's here hits some strong points and gives a nice memorial to a forgotten hero.  I was fascinated by this documentary and recommend it to anyone slightly interested.","March 28, 2019",John Werner,The Giant Killer,4.0

"I was one of the hundreds of part-time after work women's liberation feminist era organizers (of speak-outs, conferences, rallies, newsletters, women's center efforts) and was heartened by the photographs, film clips and interviews that showed groups of women working together throughout the film as those best depict the momentum of the times. I disagree with one of the last statements that radicals were all so necessary for the changes we were able to accomplish. Radicals as we generally think about them might  talk and write and sometimes teach at universities and these days tweet and FB post. Instead most of the ""radicals"" Ms. Ceballos refers to for the Miss America demonstration were just middle road  young women participating in protests many young people did at the time. However, it was hundreds and thousands of women in the middle who stepped up and out to make REAL change happen back then and in recent years, the same women responsible for the upcoming very possible election of the first woman president of the United States.Also many if not most of us were aware of the efforts of early feminists as most women's liberation anthologies included essays about them.","July 6, 2016",Lynne Shapiro,She's Beautiful When She's Angry,4.0

"This is a magical film, literally poetic. Magic surrounds the introspective bus driver and his wife. They live in a community thriving in the shadow of the great American poet William Carlos Williams. Everyone seems to be a quiet poet of one sort or another. The bus driver protagonist scribbles perpetually refined notes in a notebook, his secret notebook. We are reminded later of how much this resembles a school girl with her diary. Yet he resembles others in that everyone in town seems to be refining his own feelings in black and white. His wife, lovingly devoted to him, his writings, and their home, is a piece of poetry herself as she decorates their home in seemingly endless exploration and rediscovery of that basic black and white contrast. If you need a lot of racket to appreciate a film, watch Transformers again. But if you appreciate purity, reflection, and poetry, which can occur so rarely in American film, you will find this a five star film.","June 26, 2017",William,Paterson (4K UHD),4.0

"DENZEL!!. What a great actor! Denzel really immerses himself in his role and gives a tremendous performance in this action drama. I am surprised I missed this movie when it was released years ago. There is good dialogue, beautiful actresses, and much mystery and intrigue. Denzel's characters are not always the best role models and this movie is another example of this as he gets mixed up in a murder mystery and sexual exploits. What makes this movie so good is how his character stays one step ahead as he weaves himself in and out of trouble in clever ways. There are many twists and turns keeping the audience in suspense and rooting for the characters. The writing is very good with characters displaying great emotion, wit, humor, and ""believability"" in their roles. They also have a great rapport with each other whether they are on the same side or pitted against one another. Overall, this is a very enjoyable action movie that I definitely recommend","October 8, 2017",RH,Out of Time,4.0
"I’ve watched this movie five times since I got it on DVD, and I still don’t know what it’s about. Now, you’d think a horror movie called “The Haunting of Hell House” would center on a haunted house, but this movie doesn’t focus on any one person or location like a good haunted house movie would. Based on a story by playwright Henry James, the movie stars actor Andrew Bowen as New England college student James Farrow whose wife, maybe girlfriend, dies due to a botched abortion, and he begins to see her in dreams and hallucinations. He is soon drawn to the empty house they once explored in their youth, but now, it turns out that it belongs to a Professor Ambrose, played by the talented Michael York from the British stage. Farrow pursues York’s help to rid himself of the ghost he believes is haunting him and scratching him up, but whether it’s in his mind or just his guilt is never explained. Meanwhile, Ambrose is similarly being haunted by the ghost of his dead wife who refuses to let him sell the house. Neither man believes the ghost of the other one exists. Meanwhile, Farrow is being hunted by the police for his dead girlfriend found in his apartment. He escapes to Ambrose for protection, but the old man is dying and can’t help him. Farrow flees to the house to ask for forgiveness from his girlfriend’s ghost, but discovers Ambrose’s ghost isn’t real after all. It turns out he’s being systemically poisoned by his angry daughter and Farrow drinks the poisoned wine from her for her father to be with his bride. In the end, Farrow dies in jail next to the phony doctor who botched his girlfriend’s abortion. Is this a good movie? Uh, no. It’s long, it drags on, it’s confusing and the name of the movie is misleading. This is not a haunted house movie. This isn’t even a horror movie, and trying to make it look like one may be its worse trait. However, it does have some beautiful scenery for what I speculate is supposed to be Turn-of-the-Century New England. Overall, it’s not exactly a movie that can live up to the hype of its name.","August 17, 2015",Fred Adelman,The Haunting Of Hell House,2.0
