"This is getting a little bit clich√© already, but people watch transformers for the fights not intricate plots and dialogues. The movie created fantasies inside of the fantasy, and it's really fulfilling in the aspect of sci-fi. It's entertaining to watch, all you have to do is to sit back and relax. We're not movie critics here, and it's against moral senses to be one while watching this sort of film; it's like watchin SpongeBob and saying that you can't cook things under water.","August 27, 2018",Arze Lu,5.0
Horrible film. It's hard to follow the plot. Lots of action but very difficult to follow. The first few films in this series were fantastic. No wonder this film did not do well at the box office. It's not at the same caliber as the first few films in this series.,"July 29, 2018",Mike D,1.0
"Before you scoff at my review as being shortsighted and extremely generous, one must consider why they are watching this movie. This is a Michael Bay Transformers movie. We have already had four of them. You know that this is going to be full of ridiculously over the top special effects and incredibly confusing if cool fight scenes. One does not watch this movie for the plot, or the characters. If you are here for that, you really are just wasting your time. You are watching this movie because you want to spend a couple hours watching large robots beat the living crap out of each other while the battlefield itself crumbles and the human characters barely make it out alive. If you are here for that, then yes, you are going to enjoy this movie as I did. So sit back, crack open a dominos pizza, and prepare to be engrossed in what is undeniably the strangest, the most explosion-filled movie of 2017. You will not be disappointed. The only disappointing part of this movie is when Megatron refers to his ""crew"". Just for that, I had to flush my eyes with water, because it looks like something out of an urban culture gang movie.","July 26, 2018",Amazon Customer,5.0
"Let's face it, nobody watches a Transformers movie for the Shakespearean prose nor the intricately woven plot lines.  It's about the action, and maybe a tad bit about the sentimentality that comes from seeing your favorite childhood toys brought to life, and of course the nobility that our real world is nearly totally lacking these days.  But I went into watching this expecting the literal ""suckfest trainwreck of the century"" based upon the critics', both professional and amateur, nearly universal disdain for this film.  And ya know what?  I liked it.  If you're a Transformers fan, you know what you're approaching and what the fun is in one of these movies, and it provides that very well, at least from my perspective.  If you're not a fan, yes, you'll likely detest this movie, and would even were it literally written by Shakespeare and performed by a glittering cast of the finest thespians ever to grace the stage or this planet.  It was exciting, interesting and fun.  That's all I want from one of these movies.","November 1, 2018",R. Smith,4.0
"This movie presents absolute nonsense as a plot, then fills in its immense gaps with terrible cultural references and sexism. Despite having two and a half hours to work with the movie accomplishes nothing and is a mess of unfulfilled plot lines and bland action. The female lead is used for nothing but eye candy and the gratification of the protagonist, with every side character and returning character doing nothing but existing as a bad trope. None of the movie's events have any consequence or even reason to be shown in most cases. They slap names on things from the franchise in an attempt to give them weight along with loosely tying historical events to Transformers for no reason. I completely regret wasting my time with this.","October 17, 2018",Scott Hughes,1.0
"How did this get approval to be made? Unlike a lot of people, I actually like the Transformers movies, this one however was absolute garbage. I can see hints of a good movie but it's buried beneath absolute nonsense. Unnecessary characters, overuse of bad jokes, too many plots(some of which could have been totally done away with). I could go on, but","September 1, 2018",Slade,1.0
"Giving it a 5 to offset all the haters. Honestly it was 1000% better than the last one. Anyone watching this movie knows what they are getting into. This is action and effects... The story is ridiculous, but we are talking alien robots here... some ridiculous story should be expected. The effects are amazing and Mark does a great job moving the action along.","October 18, 2017",yeahright,5.0
The flow of the story line was a bit lacking in comparison to the previously released Transformer movies. But it's Transformers!!! It deserves 4 stars for overall entertainment value and being a movie you'll watch more than once.,"November 28, 2017",JKaye,4.0
You know a movie is confused sh*** when you forget what you are watching 10 minutes in. My only take away from this is I hope this doesn't do to Anthony Hopkins what League of Extraordinary Gentlemen did to Sean Connery's acting career.,"October 31, 2018",Ulsha,1.0
This is the worst Live-Action Transformers Movie!  I do not recommend this film. It goes against everything that the Transformers meant to fans since the 1980s. I give this movie 1 star because it is the worst of all the Michael Bay Live-Action Transformers movies!,"September 11, 2018",N. Kok,1.0
