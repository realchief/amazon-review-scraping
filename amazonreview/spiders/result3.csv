"This is getting a little bit cliché already, but people watch transformers for the fights not intricate plots and dialogues. The movie created fantasies inside of the fantasy, and it's really fulfilling in the aspect of sci-fi. It's entertaining to watch, all you have to do is to sit back and relax. We're not movie critics here, and it's against moral senses to be one while watching this sort of film; it's like watchin SpongeBob and saying that you can't cook things under water.","August 27, 2018",,Arze Lu,5.0
Horrible film. It's hard to follow the plot. Lots of action but very difficult to follow. The first few films in this series were fantastic. No wonder this film did not do well at the box office. It's not at the same caliber as the first few films in this series.,"July 29, 2018",,Mike D,1.0
"Before you scoff at my review as being shortsighted and extremely generous, one must consider why they are watching this movie. This is a Michael Bay Transformers movie. We have already had four of them. You know that this is going to be full of ridiculously over the top special effects and incredibly confusing if cool fight scenes. One does not watch this movie for the plot, or the characters. If you are here for that, you really are just wasting your time. You are watching this movie because you want to spend a couple hours watching large robots beat the living crap out of each other while the battlefield itself crumbles and the human characters barely make it out alive. If you are here for that, then yes, you are going to enjoy this movie as I did. So sit back, crack open a dominos pizza, and prepare to be engrossed in what is undeniably the strangest, the most explosion-filled movie of 2017. You will not be disappointed. The only disappointing part of this movie is when Megatron refers to his ""crew"". Just for that, I had to flush my eyes with water, because it looks like something out of an urban culture gang movie.","July 26, 2018",,Amazon Customer,5.0
"Let's face it, nobody watches a Transformers movie for the Shakespearean prose nor the intricately woven plot lines.  It's about the action, and maybe a tad bit about the sentimentality that comes from seeing your favorite childhood toys brought to life, and of course the nobility that our real world is nearly totally lacking these days.  But I went into watching this expecting the literal ""suckfest trainwreck of the century"" based upon the critics', both professional and amateur, nearly universal disdain for this film.  And ya know what?  I liked it.  If you're a Transformers fan, you know what you're approaching and what the fun is in one of these movies, and it provides that very well, at least from my perspective.  If you're not a fan, yes, you'll likely detest this movie, and would even were it literally written by Shakespeare and performed by a glittering cast of the finest thespians ever to grace the stage or this planet.  It was exciting, interesting and fun.  That's all I want from one of these movies.","November 1, 2018",,R. Smith,4.0
"This movie presents absolute nonsense as a plot, then fills in its immense gaps with terrible cultural references and sexism. Despite having two and a half hours to work with the movie accomplishes nothing and is a mess of unfulfilled plot lines and bland action. The female lead is used for nothing but eye candy and the gratification of the protagonist, with every side character and returning character doing nothing but existing as a bad trope. None of the movie's events have any consequence or even reason to be shown in most cases. They slap names on things from the franchise in an attempt to give them weight along with loosely tying historical events to Transformers for no reason. I completely regret wasting my time with this.","October 17, 2018",,Scott Hughes,1.0
"How did this get approval to be made? Unlike a lot of people, I actually like the Transformers movies, this one however was absolute garbage.

"Giving it a 5 to offset all the haters. Honestly it was 1000% better than the last one. Anyone watching this movie knows what they are getting into. This is action and effects... The story is ridiculous, but we are talking alien robots here... some ridiculous story should be expected. The effects are amazing and Mark does a great job moving the action along.","October 18, 2017",,yeahright,5.0

You know a movie is confused sh*** when you forget what you are watching 10 minutes in. My only take away from this is I hope this doesn't do to Anthony Hopkins what League of Extraordinary Gentlemen did to Sean Connery's acting career.,"October 31, 2018",,Ulsha,1.0
This is the worst Live-Action Transformers Movie!  I do not recommend this film. It goes against everything that the Transformers meant to fans since the 1980s. I give this movie 1 star because it is the worst of all the Michael Bay Live-Action Transformers movies!,"September 11, 2018",,N. Kok,1.0
"Walking into the theater to see BUMBLEBEE, I was mad at myself, mad for getting suckered in again. Every time I thought I was dunzo with this franchise, out comes a snazzy trailer to hook me back in, and I'd go, ""Maybe this is the good one.""","December 25, 2018",,H. Bala,5.0
"THE FILM: This is where it all started: where big-budget blockbusters started to dumb down at a higher rate, and where Michael Bay's career started to coalesce into the cynical (but very profitable) mess it is today. That being said, TRANSFORMERS is still rather entertaining if you take if for what it is. The plot is as convoluted as expected, yet probably the simplest one in the series. The Autobots must find the Allspark before the Decepticons do, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is an integral part in helping them. Aside from that, you have Michael Bay's usual fixation with military hardware, hot models, cool cars, and 'splosions. He really does have a distinct style in his body of work, for better or worse. Watching it for the second or third time, all I could really think about was how unfunny the humor was, and how the camera-work was headache-inducing. Yet, this first Transformers movie remains watchable if for no other reason than that I know the quality is all downhill from here. The acting is decent, for the most part. The visual effects still hold up really well, even if most of the robot action is obfuscated with clever camera angles and ""shaky cam."" Slow motion is really the only time the viewer is given the opportunity to take in some of the best visual moments. The score is also decent and doesn't really get in the way. When it comes down to it, I don't like this as much as I may have the first time, but it still entertained me. Occasionally, something that speaks to one's inner 12-year-old can be fun, and that's basically what TRANSFORMERS is.","July 5, 2015",,Robert Hayes,4.0
"I really enjoyed this 3rd movie in the Transformers franchise.  Unlike the 2nd film (Revenge/Fallen, which was too long and appeared to leave nothing on the cutting room floor, to its detriment),  this film was relatively short and concise, to the point, and without a lot of filler.  It had a somewhat more serious tone than the previous 2 films too.  Although the first film is special, in that it gave us new sci-fi characters in a fresh format, this film expanded the Transformer universe well.  And the tie in with our 1969 moon landing was cool too.","January 13, 2017",,sasesq,4.0
"I first saw this movie in the theater when it was first released.  I just watched it again on Amazon Prime Video to give it a 2nd chance.  I feel like something important is missing from this movie.  Something about storytelling.  I can't put my finger on it.  It seems like they released the movie before they were really finished with it.  The characters didn't seem like real people to me.  The CGI and sound track was first rate, creative, and worthy of blockbuster movies.  Kudos to the tech team.  But the story and plot feels like it was all created by a computer too.  Did a real human being write this?  It seemed like there were many good scenes but they weren't put together well enough. The story was okay but the storytelling was flawed somehow.  I felt frustrated because it was a lot of work to make sense of the plot sometimes.  I don't understand how Steven Spielberg could have put his name on this.  During the filming phase the actors probably can't tell how the final product would look.  I just feel like they must be disappointed by how it finally turned out.  There were some good moments in the movie but there were some very frustrating moments too. This was a failure of management judgement.  It didn't have to be a dud movie.  But somebody in charge dropped the ball on this one.","September 1, 2015",,Hoofhearted1000,2.0
I am disappointed by this movie. It's extremely vulgar. There's little to no substance in the plot. The Transformers themselves are almost inconsequential. It feels like you could put any giant robot into the movie and it would still work. Just take out the words energon and all spark. Those are the only two words in the movie that make it feel like Transformers for me.,"December 4, 2018",,CaylaShopsxo,2.0

This is a movie that had no idea what it's point was.  There's a story in there about Mark Walberg helping the now-outlawed Transformers survive and adopting a cute kid.

Some reviewers would have you believe this movie wasn't very good. Others will try to convince you its all about the action. Its not the movie is about Transformers who are sassy and Anthony Hopkins who topped all his previous roles with his mind blowing performance. I'm not kidding Silence of the Lambs has nothing on this movie. The cast did an amazing job I think its my favorite yet of the Transformers movies. How can you lot laugh and be taken back by the tech all in the same scene. Watch it for yourself and see you won't regret it. I'm going to rewatch it right now actually.,"November 19, 2018",,N.

"this is more of a review of the prime streaming service and possibly the agreement between the production studio and amazon that this movie is protected by some sort of anti piracy which disables your ability to watch the movie in HD. The picture quality was terrible, and you know what you have when youre watching a transformers movie in 240p? a mess. I had to sit here with my friend hunched over my phone for 2 hours to get decent quality while all of my DM notifications kept popping up covering up 1/4th the screen while my friend read it all. terrible experience, plus the movie kinda sucks too but id rate it a 2. Also the outsourced customer service was zero help. had her on chat for 30 minutes before she realized the copyright protection program was the issue and told me that i either cant watch the movie or have to buy some kind of device that plays amazon. what a disaster","January 14, 2019",,Robert,1.0
"Paper thin characters? Check. Outright chauvinism and objectification of women? Double check. A total disregard for what makes a coherent movie? Triple check. Cade Yeager (ugh) is on the run and making vaguely racist comments all over the place (he calls a Native American police officer ""Chief"" and a Latina girl ""Little JLo"") and he's somehow the Last Knight (whatever that means). Optimus Prime has about 20 minutes of screentime in this indecipherable mess, so he shouldn't have been featured so pominently in the marketing. Don't watch this movie.","December 28, 2018",,Josiah G. Glickstein,1.0
"Here's the thing. My heart wants to give this 5 stars bc of the last 30min alone, but I have to be honest and knock off a point for that jumbled narrative. The third time you see it, it tracks better, but first-time viewers will find it a frustrating, disorienting nonsense. The plot is a confusing mess, told like a kid w/ ADD trying to give a book report in summer school. The dialog & acting is too full of hyper-frantic camp that just feels forced and phony. Some characters too often contradict their own nature, feeling almost schizo, & making completely absurd decisions, with too many nonsensical & erratic mood shifts, while settings and temperaments change extremely haphazardly and implausibly, even for a Bay film. Which rushes you into bonkers action setpieces w/ very poor illustration of what's happening and why, and often completely absurd justifications, even w/in its own fictional context. To top it all off, the extreme destruction that humans regularly survive is by now so far beyond absurd as to almost ruin the movie.  BUT THEN... THE LAST 30-45min. IS ONE OF THE MOST INCREDIBLE THINGS EVER PUT ON SCREEN, PERIOD. I'm still astounded, speechless, and utterly in awe. At least from watching it on a giant screen. It mostly makes up for the other nonsense, and speaking as a guy who knows film, is one of the all-time best masterclasses in epic cinematography. Four stars for that alone, 2 stars w/o it, and would be dozens of stars if the narrative were solid as well.","January 20, 2019",,JHAZZAMM!,4.0

"I thought it was going very well, except for the obvious attempt at eye candy instead of real people. But then there were so many scenes that just weren't paid attention to. An actor's clothes changing in the same scene but different camera angle: as in an entire shirt coming off or hat being added to disappear later. This giant autobot popping up in the background of the room with no one noticing like he was there the entire time. A sword that lasted over 3/4s of the plot being used for 3 seconds (impossibly, I might add) and then just suddenly disappearing and it's like it had no purpose at all because it's use made zero sense. And I can't get over these insanely MASSIVE machines slamming things down, falling making the ground shake, causing large explosions, etc. and the humans 2 feet away or LESS don't even blink.","January 12, 2019",,Michelle Aertker,1.0

This is Wahlbergs best comedy performance yet... and he did it without Will Ferrel. So much FX silliness and witty back and forth with the supporting characters that didn't fit into anything that was going on was a hoot. I hope Michael Bay takes his skills into the Marvel Universe in the future.,"December 27, 2018",,Mark,5.0
"It seems like a bunch of scenes pasted together with no logic or plot happening. It's like watching a bad clip show of previous Transformers movies. If it gets better after the point where I stopped watching, then someone needs to convince me that it's worth my time.","June 22, 2018",,Mike R.,1.0
Buenos días a la comunidad le escribo el siguiente comentario Transformers  there last night  es una excelente película de acuerdo con su fotografía en aspectos de la historia pues pudiera ser a gusto de cada quien como  la mayoría de las cosas pero si vale la pena comprarlo en 4K definitivamente sí es un hecho si quieres hacer lucir tu televisor son uno de estos títulos que debe existir en tu biblioteca,"March 30, 2019",, Oscar Carrillo ,5.0
"This movie was all over the place. No character development. ""I am Optimus Prime,"" repeated over and over.  We get it already!  It reminded me of the last miniseries of the original cartoons back in the day when new characters were being introduced every few seconds.","February 20, 2019",,Nicole Butler,3.0
"I must admit, I was really looking forward to this movie, but I was really disappointed by it. The story is extremely disjointed and some of the conversations seem like they're referencing deleted scenes. I added a star because some of the fight scenes are pretty cool, but the final battle was actually quite the opposite. It seemed like huge chunks of the story just got lost and you're left jumping around wondering why something happened. The script tried to be witty and funny at times but almost every time it just seemed forced and didn't have anything to do with what was actually happening.","November 11, 2018",,Amazon Customer,2.0
"Walking into the theater to see BUMBLEBEE, I was mad at myself, mad for getting suckered in again. Every time I thought I was dunzo with this franchise, out comes a snazzy trailer to hook me back in, and I'd go, ""Maybe this is the good one.""","December 25, 2018",,H. Bala,5.0
"THE FILM: This is where it all started: where big-budget blockbusters started to dumb down at a higher rate, and where Michael Bay's career started to coalesce into the cynical (but very profitable) mess it is today. That being said, TRANSFORMERS is still rather entertaining if you take if for what it is. The plot is as convoluted as expected, yet probably the simplest one in the series. The Autobots must find the Allspark before the Decepticons do, and Sam Witwicky (Shia LeBeouf) is an integral part in helping them. Aside from that, you have Michael Bay's usual fixation with military hardware, hot models, cool cars, and 'splosions. He really does have a distinct style in his body of work, for better or worse. Watching it for the second or third time, all I could really think about was how unfunny the humor was, and how the camera-work was headache-inducing. Yet, this first Transformers movie remains watchable if for no other reason than that I know the quality is all downhill from here. The acting is decent, for the most part. The visual effects still hold up really well, even if most of the robot action is obfuscated with clever camera angles and ""shaky cam."" Slow motion is really the only time the viewer is given the opportunity to take in some of the best visual moments. The score is also decent and doesn't really get in the way. When it comes down to it, I don't like this as much as I may have the first time, but it still entertained me. Occasionally, something that speaks to one's inner 12-year-old can be fun, and that's basically what TRANSFORMERS is.","July 5, 2015",,Robert Hayes,4.0
"I really enjoyed this 3rd movie in the Transformers franchise.  Unlike the 2nd film (Revenge/Fallen, which was too long and appeared to leave nothing on the cutting room floor, to its detriment),  this film was relatively short and concise, to the point, and without a lot of filler.  It had a somewhat more serious tone than the previous 2 films too.  Although the first film is special, in that it gave us new sci-fi characters in a fresh format, this film expanded the Transformer universe well.  And the tie in with our 1969 moon landing was cool too.","January 13, 2017",,sasesq,4.0
"I first saw this movie in the theater when it was first released.  I just watched it again on Amazon Prime Video to give it a 2nd chance.  I feel like something important is missing from this movie.  Something about storytelling.  I can't put my finger on it.  It seems like they released the movie before they were really finished with it.  The characters didn't seem like real people to me.  The CGI and sound track was first rate, creative, and worthy of blockbuster movies.  Kudos to the tech team.  But the story and plot feels like it was all created by a computer too.  Did a real human being write this?  It seemed like there were many good scenes but they weren't put together well enough. The story was okay but the storytelling was flawed somehow.  I felt frustrated because it was a lot of work to make sense of the plot sometimes.  I don't understand how Steven Spielberg could have put his name on this.  During the filming phase the actors probably can't tell how the final product would look.  I just feel like they must be disappointed by how it finally turned out.  There were some good moments in the movie but there were some very frustrating moments too. This was a failure of management judgement.  It didn't have to be a dud movie.  But somebody in charge dropped the ball on this one.","September 1, 2015",,Hoofhearted1000,2.0
I am disappointed by this movie. It's extremely vulgar. There's little to no substance in the plot. The Transformers themselves are almost inconsequential. It feels like you could put any giant robot into the movie and it would still work. Just take out the words energon and all spark. Those are the only two words in the movie that make it feel like Transformers for me.,"December 4, 2018",,CaylaShopsxo,2.0
"So it seems most reviews fall into 1 of 2 polarized camps. Either you think the movie is $#!% because of the horrible story-lines, nonsensical dialogue, annoying characters, etc, OR you say the movie isn't about that plot,characters, and dialogue, it's about giant robots and epic situations doing cool stuff.","January 12, 2019",,Daniel Moyer,1.0
"read a lot of controversy about this movie. but in my opinion, it was a pretty danged GOOD Movie! no matter what others have opinionated about it...I still LIKED it! wandering if the entail is going to produce another movie? hope so...","October 27, 2018",,LaFaye,5.0
"This franchise really went off the rails. I have no idea what they were thinking or what substances they were possibly abusing while these films were being made. This is not a good film, but it's far from the worst. There are some cool plot points and the setup for Unicron is really great to see in a Hollywood movie, but that's where the praise ends. Much like most of the films in the franchise, a lot happens, but nothing is really accomplished. The plot makes little sense and continuity is thrown away from previous films. Honestly, if you have nothing else to watch or you just wanna put something on while you're working, check it out. Beyond watching it for free on Prime or something of the sort, don't pay money for this.","December 3, 2018",,Mr. G,2.0
"Ever see a movie so bad, you swear it was made to be directly used in one of those disneyland immersive video rides? Well, if you need plot holes introduced to cover for other plot holes and Sir Anthony Hopkins flipping the bird to evil robot cars, you are in for a treat. it is a movie for 9 year olds with violence and language they should never see.","January 2, 2019",,bradley d phelan,1.0
"The first Transformers film was phenomenal. The 2nd one was horrible, the 3rd one was good, 4th one was just okay...But this one? Just as horrible if not worse than two. I'm hoping Bay is done making these films...New directors need a shot at the franchise . Stick to war movies please Mr. Bay.","January 24, 2019",,TowerKnight,1.0
"I have nothing really against the movie, it was well done with the effects, and the storyline.. However the one gripe I have about the movie is that it absolutely DESTROYS our childhood..","November 10, 2018",,Amazon Customer,4.0
"Wow I'm blown away. I'm blown away that i trusted all the people who reviewed this movie in a negative light. To be absolutely honest with anyone reading this, if you like transformers this is the best one. Everyone is giving the story a hard time and i just cant accept that. The story was great and extremely straight forward. Yeah, this movie is pure fun and joy from beginning to end. I will never trust movie critics as long as i live. All these years i wasted wondering if I'd like this film and in the end it was my favorite of them all. My advice see it for yourself. Rent it if you have too and then judge it. Accept it for the fun ride that it was.","April 6, 2019",,Dustin McLean ,5.0
